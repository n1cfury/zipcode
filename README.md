# Zipcode changer
How much different would your life be by changing any one number in your zip code. I've lived and travelled to much of the United States and seen drastic differences in demographics, weather, and a plethora of other factors that would drastically change the makeup of how someone lives and interacts with people. 

Even in places like California a suburb and a slum are usually very close to each other. 

This program is simple. You enter a zip code in, and it will return a random one with the city and state of the original and new location. I may add more interesting things like geographical data or crime statistics later. 

If the new zip code returns doesn't exist, it will let you know so try running it again.
